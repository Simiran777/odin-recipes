      <p>Whether you keep them on hand for quick lunches or serve them for dinner tonight, a juicy Grilled Chicken Breast is the perfect way to upgrade any meal.
        Lean, healthy, and versatile, grilled chicken breasts are full of potential (paired up with <a href="recipes/pasta.html">Pasta</a> for starters and <a href="recipes/chocolateBananaBread.html">Chocolate Banana Bread</a>, <strong>YOU CAN SURELY THROW A PARTY!</strong>).
      </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li>Chicken Marinade (No matter which marinade you choose, it is critical to create the juiciest and most flavorful chicken breast.) </li>
        <li>Any of your favourite toppings (p.s. I love this Avocado Crunch!!!) </li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Pound the chicken breasts.</li>
        <li>Poke holes in the chicken.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken to a ziptop bag with the marinade. Seal and let marinate at room temperature (for at least 30 minutes) or in the refrigerator (for up to 12 hours).</li>
        <li>Let the chicken come to room temperature (if refrigerated). Grill chicken directly on the grill grates at 475 degrees F for 4 to 5 minutes on the first side and 4 to 8 minutes on the other side</li>
        <li>Let it rest for a few minutes, add toppings, and DIG IN!</li>
      </ol>
